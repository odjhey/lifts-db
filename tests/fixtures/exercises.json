Maintain good spinal position with your head and chest up.\nSupporting the weight, fully extend the knee and unlock the sled. This will be your starting position.\nLower the weight by flexing the hip and knee, continuing as far as flexibility allows. Do not allow your lumbar to take the load by moving your pelvis.\nAt the bottom of the motion pause briefly and then return to the starting position by extending the hip and knee.\nComplete all repetitions for one leg before switching to the other."
